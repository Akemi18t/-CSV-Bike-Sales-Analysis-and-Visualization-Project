# -CSV-Analysis of Bike Sales and Consumer Behavior
This project utilizes a CSV file to gather and preprocess data, followed by creating visualizations.
For those unable to access the raw data directly, I've included visualization graphs generated using Tableau in the README.md section.

# Introduction

# Tools Used 
In my thorough exploration of the data analyst job market, I utilized a range of essential tools:

- Microsoft Excel: Used to gather and preprocess data, followed by creating visualizations.
- Tableau: Leveraged as my visualization tool to present data with clarity, using graphs, bars, and packed bubbles for easy comprehension.


# The Analysis If you can't download the raw data, I have also made a dashboard using Tableau

### 1. Gender-Based Average Income Per Purchased
In this analysis, we explore the relationship between gender and average income per bike purchase across different age bracketsâ€”Adolescent, Middle Age, and Older Adults. 
The graphs depict how purchasing behavior varies among genders within each age category, providing insights into consumer spending patterns and preferences across different demographic segments. 

### 2. Influence of Marital Status, Children, and Average Income on Bike Purchase Behavior
This analysis examines how marital status (married or single), gender-specific average income, and the presence of children influence bike purchase behavior. 

### 3. Commute Distance and Home Ownership on Bike Purchases 
This analysis examines the relationship between commute distance, home ownership, average salaries, and their influence on bike purchases. By studying these variables, I aim to uncover how commute distance and home ownership status impact consumer behavior in the bike market. 

### 4. Relationship Between Region, Education, and Bike Purchase Behavior
This analysis explores how region (Europe, North America, Pacific) and education level influence bike purchase behavior. By examining these factors, we aim to understand regional and educational differences in consumer decisions within the cycling market. 

# Conclution
1. ***Gender-Based Average Income Per Purchased**:

2. ***Influence of Marital Status, Children, and Average Income on Bike Purchase Behavior**:


3. ***Commute Distance and Home Ownership on Bike Purchases**:
