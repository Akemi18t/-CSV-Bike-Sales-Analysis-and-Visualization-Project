# -CSV-Analysis of Bike Sales and Consumer Behavior
This project utilizes a CSV file to gather and preprocess data, followed by creating visualizations.
For those unable to access the raw data directly, I've included visualization graphs generated using Tableau in the README.md section.

# Introduction
This project explores the factors influencing bike purchase behavior, focusing on demographics such as gender, age, marital status, and the presence of children, as well as economic indicators like income levels. Additionally, I have analyzed how commute distance, home ownership, and regional influences impact consumer decisions within the cycling market. 

# Tools Used 
In my thorough exploration of the data analyst job market, I utilized a range of essential tools:

- Microsoft Excel: Used to gather and preprocess data, followed by creating visualizations.
- Tableau: Leveraged as my visualization tool to present data with clarity, using graphs, bars, and packed bubbles for easy comprehension.


# The Analysis 
- If you can't download the raw data, I have made a dashboard using Tableau as well.

### 1. Gender-Based Average Income Per Purchased
In this analysis, we explore the relationship between gender and average income per bike purchase across different age bracketsâ€”Adolescent, Middle Age, and Older Adults. 
The graphs depict how purchasing behavior varies among genders within each age category, providing insights into consumer spending patterns and preferences across different demographic segments. 

### 2. Influence of Marital Status, Children, and Average Income on Bike Purchase Behavior
This analysis examines how marital status (married or single), gender-specific average income, and the presence of children influence bike purchase behavior. 

### 3. Commute Distance and Home Ownership on Bike Purchases 
This analysis examines the relationship between commute distance, home ownership, average salaries, and their influence on bike purchases. By studying these variables, I aim to uncover how commute distance and home ownership status impact consumer behavior in the bike market. 

### 4. Relationship Between Region, Education, and Bike Purchase Behavior
This analysis explores how region (Europe, North America, Pacific) and education level influence bike purchase behavior. By examining these factors, I have aimed to understand regional and educational differences in consumer decisions within the cycling market. 

# Conclution
1. ***Gender-Based Average Income Per Purchased**:
The analysis reveals notable trends in bike purchasing behavior based on gender and age groups. Both male and female adolescents show lower bike purchase rates compared to middle-aged and older adults. Interestingly, middle-aged and older males, with an average income of $63,000, demonstrate a higher propensity to purchase bikes compared to their female counterparts earning an average of $58,000. This disparity suggests that income and possibly cultural factors influence bike purchasing decisions across different demographic groups.

2. ***Influence of Marital Status, Children, and Average Income on Bike Purchase Behavior**:
The data indicates that married males with an average income of $61,301 and one child exhibit the highest likelihood of purchasing bikes. Conversely, both married males and females who do not purchase bikes tend to have two or more children, potentially indicating they rely on existing bikes within the household for family use. Single males with lower average incomes tend to show lower bike purchase rates, while those with higher incomes are more likely to buy bikes regardless of marital status. These findings suggest that income plays a significant role in bike purchasing decisions rather than marital status.

3. ***Commute Distance and Home Ownership on Bike Purchases**:
Analysis of commute distance and home ownership reveals nuanced preferences in bike purchasing. Individuals with commute distances exceeding 10 miles, particularly those without homeownership, show a higher inclination towards bike purchases. This trend could indicate a preference for biking over public transit for longer commutes. Conversely, the difference in bike purchase rates between homeowners and non-homeowners with shorter commutes is minimal, suggesting personal commuting preferences strongly influence bike purchasing decisions.

4. ***Relationship Between Region, Education, and Bike Purchase Behavior**:
The analysis across different regions (North America, Europe, Pacific) and educational levels highlights varying attitudes towards bike purchases. Generally, individuals from North America show the highest propensity to purchase bikes across all educational backgrounds, except for high school graduates. Conversely, Pacific residents exhibit the lowest inclination towards bike purchases, which may reflect cultural differences in transportation preferences.

These conclusions integrate insights from each analysis while emphasizing the importance of income, family dynamics, commute preferences, and regional culture in influencing bike purchase behavior.
